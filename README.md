## Quick Start Guide

To get up and running with our plugin quickly, see the GUIDE here: https://github.com/btcpayserver/prestashop-plugin/blob/master/GUIDE.md


# Internals

This plugin only generate Prestashop order and invoice (aka postponed order), when payment is received.
Prestashop design ensure customer is ready to pay, with a checkbox, when he is forwarded to payment processor.


# TODO
Their is still a lot's of place for improvement.
* ~~on/off postponed order~~
* ~~direct configuration for block confirmations~~
* composer with php-bitpay-client
* docker for testing
* travis integration
* check 1.6.X compatibility
* ensure stats are correctly displayed in prestashop
* share the same order number BTCPay server and prestashop, or give insight in order details
* give bitcoin rate in local currency in order details
* still in order details, give exact time of payment and bitcoin transaction
* find a way to not override order state numbers currently used in case another plugin use it.
e.g: plugin use order state id: 39,40,41,42.  Should use 49,50,51,52 if other plugins use the first one.
* refactoring in ipn.php
